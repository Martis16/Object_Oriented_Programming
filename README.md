# Object_Oriented_Programming with c#
Info: These are the projects I created in my first year as a student. All of the projects are coded in MS Visual Studio (2017-2022).

LAB1
<br>Task:
<br>• Create a class called "Student" with variables to store age and height. Three students decided to practice basketball. Find out the age of the tallest student and the height of the youngest student.
<br>• Add a variable to the "Student" class to store the student's weight. Create a class called "Elevator" with variables for the lifting power and capacity of the elevator. Will all the students be able to lift the elevator to the required height several times?
<br>• Add methods to the "Elevator" class, such as "Set()", which allow changing the lifting power and capacity of the elevator. Will all the students be lifted to the required height at the same time if the lifting power of the elevator is doubled? What if the capacity is doubled?
<br><br>
LAB2
<br>Task:
<br>• The list of attendees to basketball school training sessions is in a text file: future basketball player's name, surname, age, and height. The first line contains the name of the basketball school. Create a class called Player, which should have variables for storing the name, surname, age, and height. Find the average age and the average height of the future basketball players.
<br>• Enhance the program with actions involving data from two basketball schools. The data for each school is stored in separate files. In which school is the tallest athlete? Compile a separate set containing all athletes from both schools whose height is greater than the average.
<br><br>
LAB3
<br>Task:
To compare the prepaid SIM cards offered by mobile operators, Sirvydas collected this information into a text file:
<br>• The file contains card data in lines: card (network) name, initial balance on the card, tariff within the network, tariff to other networks, SMS tariff within the network, and to other networks.
<br>• Write a program that prints the card data in a table, finds the card with the lowest SMS tariffs to other networks.
<br>• Enhance the program with actions that allow you to select cards that allow free calling and texting within their own network, and sort this list by the initial balance in descending order and the card name alphabetically.
<br><br>
LAB4
<br>Task:
<br>• Text is provided in a text file. Words are not moved from one line to another.
<br>• Words in lines are separated by at least one space.
<br>• Spaces can be at the beginning and end of the line, and there can be empty lines.
<br>• In lines with an odd number of words n, replace the n / 2 + 1 word with the word "xxooxx".
<br><br>
LAB5
<br>Task:
<br>• In the first line of the file, the number of football teams is specified. The following lines provide information about football teams: name, city, coach's surname, first name. Below is the table of results for the first round, expressed in goals scored.
<br>• Calculate the number of points earned by each team, with 3 points awarded for a win and 1 point for a draw.
<br>• Compile a tournament table for the teams - arrange the points earned in descending order. If teams have the same number of points, the team with more wins should be placed higher.
<br>• Find the team that scored the most goals.
<br>• Find the teams that conceded the fewest goals in matches.
